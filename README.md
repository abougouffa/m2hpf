# m2hpf
### *HPF - DT High Performance File Format* high speed decoding library (for Modula-2 programming language)

The current version of `m2hpf` supports **only reading** *.hpf files. `m2hpf` cannot be used to write files in HPF format.

This implementation is based on the DT HPF file format, which is described in a document I found [some where on the internet](https://forums.ni.com/ni/attachments/ni/170/813238/1/high_performance_file_format_spec%5B1%5D.pdf) entitled **DT High Performance File Format Specification**

The `m2hpf` library implements a slightly modified version of the format described in the document above,
it has been written to support the actual format of [Delsys EMGworks](https://www.delsys.com) signals.

This library is made to provide quick data access, to be used in real-time signal processing project, so for example; using this library to implement a *HPF to CSV* file converter will be much more efficient than using the *Delsys File Utility*.

The library has been written in Modula-2 programming language for an internal use. Now it is published under LGPL-3.0.

### Compiling `m2hpf`
`m2hpf` has been tested on the **[ADW Modula-2](https://www.modula2.org/adwm2/)** compiler on a Win 32-bit target.

The `m2hpf` is implemented using the Modula-2 ISO standard, but uses some ADW Modula-2 language extensions and the specific compiler directive `<*/PACK*>` in `HPFFile.def`. 

For this implementation to work also with another ISO compliant compiler, you need to find an equivalent directive to `<*/PACK*>` for your compiler. You will need to modify the `HPFFile.def` to use the equivalent directive, and modify some ADW Modula-2 specific code, like in the hardcoded values in the [`CHUNK_ID`](https://github.com/abougouffa/m2hpf/blob/master/def/HPFFile.def#L62-L68) enumeration.

For example, in **[GNU Modula-2](https://www.nongnu.org/gm2/homepage.html)**, there is an equivalent [`<* bytealignment (x) *>` pragma](https://www.nongnu.org/gm2/12/packed.html), however, you still need to modify the code yourself, and find an alternative way to deal with the hardcoded enumerations issue.
